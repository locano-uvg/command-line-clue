## Notes

In the houses i found the blacksmith and gloves
In the cottage i found noyhing, also nothing on the rooms there
In the greenhouse of the garden i found a clue that told me to go to the meeting rooms on the town hall offices 
I looked for the clue ond the meeting rooms, but it just told me to go to the kitchen in the school, I also searched fot objects or people near but found nothing
In the school kitchen I found out that the crime happened here

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...

Just basing from the clues and the place it was commited, i think it was the artist, because it makes more sense for him to be in the school kitchen, and probably his tool was the paint brush
